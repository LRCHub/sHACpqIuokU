The lost art of writing a letter
Has been distilled down to nudes and follow requests
Sometimes I'm the debt collector
Reachin' for love, I'm beggin' on the internet
The whole-hearted explanation
Has fought the condemnation of savin' face
Since time was the shaky-footstepped fawn from outer space

If I let you down, don't wait around
What good is good advice, yeah, just before you hit the ground?
What do you feel? Let's keep it real
What good is good advice, yeah, if it's my Achilles' Heel?

I think I need therapy, something's wrong

"I never thought it once", yeah, that's a lie
Never came second, yeah, don't be shy
Third time lucky, we stayed polite
It was more like four with an appetite, yeah
Five times, we're gettin' it right
Six cold sweats, there's seven, eight, nine!
Death by a thousand cuts
And we didn't even have to try

The lost art of writin' a record
Has been distilled down to makin' the playlist
Sometimes I'm lost for hope
And maybe I might "Cease! Desist!"
What does it take 'til it breaks
In the UK, or the States?
This hometown hero has a window he can race

If I let you down, don't wait around
What good is good advice, yeah, just before you hit the ground?
What do you feel? Let's keep it real
What good is good advice, yeah, if it's my Achilles' Heel?

I think I need therapy, something's wrong

"I never thought it once", yeah, that's a lie
Never came second, yeah, don't be shy
Third time lucky, we stayed polite
It was more like four with an appetite, yeah
Five times, we're gettin' it right
Six cold sweats, there's seven, eight, nine!
Death by a thousand cuts
And we didn't even have to try

What good is good advice if it's my Achilles' Heel?
What good is good advice if it's my Achilles' Heel?
What good is good advice if it's my Achilles' Heel?
What good is good advice if it's my Achilles' Heel?

I think I need therapy, something's wrong

If I let you down, don't wait around
What good is good advice, yeah, just before you hit the ground?
What do you feel? Let's keep it real
What good is good advice, yeah, if it's my Achilles' Heel?
