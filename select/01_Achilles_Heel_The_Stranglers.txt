Fast times are catching up on you
Saying there's time to fill
Time to fill
It's tough to keep your head on round the right way
And your body still
Your body still
So come on it's no come on
So budge it it won't budge it
When the floor is a waving sea
And I see the door opening up on me
You're trap door looks an inviting thrill
And I feel it in my Achilles Heel
I feel it in my Achilles Heel

We don't seem to have the time of day
For any sunken keel
Sunken keel
We're all frightened of a darkness in the daytime
And a lust to kill
A lust to kill
So come on it's no come on
So budge it it won't budge it

When the floor is a waving sea
And I see the door opening up on me
You're trap door looks an inviting thrill
And I feel it in my Achilles Heel
I feel it in my Achilles Heel

I feel it I feel it
In my Achilles, my Achilles Heel

When the floor is a waving sea
And I see the door opening up on me
You're trap door looks an inviting thrill
And I feel it in my Achilles Heel
I feel it in my Achilles Heel

I feel it I feel it
In my Achilles, my Achilles Heel.
