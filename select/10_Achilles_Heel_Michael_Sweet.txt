(verse 1)

There's something wrenching in your brain
Unbearable pressure and pain
Those thoughts you have inside your head
Seem to be stirring what you've fled

Chorus

Shot to the spot, achilles heel
You know the pain is real
Addictive chain around your neck
Your life is what it steals
You're falling apart, it's in your eyes
Don't reach for yourself, reach for the sky

(verse 2)

Desolation is your next of kin
Lonely outcries are your only friends
You find no answers in your heart
You had no direction from the start

Chorus

Shot to the spot, achilles heel
You know the pain is real
Addictive chain around your neck
Your life is what it steals
You're falling apart, it's in your eyes
Don't reach for yourself, reach for the sky
